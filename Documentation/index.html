            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>A React Native Online Shopping App with complete backend integration.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>App is built using Redux and is performance optimised which helps you to develop world-class application experiences on native platforms. This gives your app a consistent look and feel with the rest of the platform ecosystem, and keeps the quality bar high.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>React Version: 18.2.0</li>
            <li>React Native Version: 0.72.3</li>
            <li>React Navigation Version: 6.1.7</li>
            <li>Redux Version: 4.2.1</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The app includes all essential screen along with many customisable options through a configuration file.</p>
          <p>In this documentation we will explore everything in this app so you can get started with the app.</p>
          <p>Let's get started.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <h4>Requirements</h4>
          </blockquote>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">NodeJS</div>
          <p>Make sure you have a recent version (16 or newer) of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a> installed globally.</p>
          <p>We recommend installing Node and Watchman using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew.</a> Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:</p>
          <p>brew install node<br/>brew install watchman</p>
          <p>If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 16 or newer.</p>
          <br />

          <h5 class="fw-normal mb-2">For IOS View</h5>

          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Xcode & CocoaPods</div>
          <p>The easiest way to install Xcode is via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store.</a> Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.</p>
          <p>If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 10 or newer.</p>
          <i class="fw-500">Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode</i>
          <p>To install a simulator, open <b>Xcode > Preferences…</b> and select the <b>Components</b> tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.</p>
          <i class="fw-500">CocoaPods</i>
          <p>
            <a href="https://cocoapods.org/" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a> is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. It is built with Ruby and you can install it using the version of Ruby you configured with in the previous steps.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h5 class="fw-normal mb-2">For Android View</h5>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Java Development Kit</div>
          <p>We recommend installing the OpenJDK distribution called Azul Zulu using <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew.</a> Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:</p>
          <p>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions<br />
          brew install --cask zulu11</p>
          <p>The Zulu OpenJDK distribution offers JDKs for both Intel and M1 Macs. This will make sure your builds are faster on M1 Macs compared to using an Intel-based JDK.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">If you have already installed JDK on your system, we recommend JDK 11. You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions.</p>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mb-2">Android development environment</div>
          <p>please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">1. Install Android Studio</i>
          <p class="mt-2">Download and <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">install Android Studio.</a> While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android SDK</li>
            <li>Android SDK Platform</li>
            <li>Android Virtual Device</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.</p>
          <p>Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">2. Install the Android SDK</i>
          <p class="mt-2">Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the Android 13 (Tiramisu) SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.<br />To do that, open Android Studio, click on "More Actions" button and select "SDK Manager".</p>
          <img src="./assets/images/android-wlc.png" class="img-fluid"/>
          <p>Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the Android 13 (Tiramisu) entry, then make sure the following items are checked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android SDK Platform 33</li>
            <li>Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image or Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image or (for Apple M1 Silicon) Google APIs ARM 64
            v8a System Image</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that 33.0.0 is selected.</p>
          <p>Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.</p>

          <i class="fw-500">3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable</i>
          <p class="mt-2">The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.</p>
          <p>Add the following lines to your ~/.zprofile or ~/.zshrc (if you are using bash, then ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc) config file:

          </p>
          <p>
            export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk<br />
            export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator<br />
            export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
          </p>
          <p>Run source ~/.zprofile (or source ~/.bash_profile for bash) to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been set by running echo $ANDROID_HOME and the appropriate directories have been added to your path by running echo $PATH.</p>
          <div class="fs-6 fw-bold mt-3 mb-2">React Native Command Line Interface</div>
          <p>React Native has a built-in command line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using npx, which ships with Node.js. With npx react-native <command>, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.</p>
